Create a TypeScript program that simulates a simple Bank Account Management System.

The program should allow users to perform basic banking operations such as Creating an Account, Depositing Funds, Withdrawing Funds, and Checking their Balance.

Additionally, implement a feature to display the account details including the Account Holder's Name, Account Number, and Current Balance.
