Mr Peter is a salesman. He gets a commission on each sale made. He maintains his commission amount in his record book. He realized that maintaining a record book is tedious and hence decided to meet his friend, John. John suggested him to opt for a Sales Commission Calculator System. Now you, being a programmer, have to develop the system by calculating the commission according to the following rates:

|     Sales     | Commission Rate |
|:-------------:|:---------------:|
| 50001 onwards |       30%       |
| 40001 - 50000 |       20%       |
| 30001 - 40000 |       15%       |
| 20001 - 30000 |       10%       |
| 10001 - 20000 |        8%       |
| 0     - 10000 |        5%       |

The Sales Commission Calculator System should accept the sales made by the salesman and display the calculated commission using if-else-if ladder.
