**Exploring Function Overloading in TypeScript**

1. Implementing Basic Function Overloading:

- Create a TypeScript file and define a function called calculateArea.
- Overload the calculateArea function to accept different shapes such as circle, rectangle, and triangle.
- Implement each overload with appropriate parameter types and return types.

2. Calculating Areas:

- Implement the calculation logic for each shape in the calculateArea function overloads.
- For the circle, use the formula: Ï€ * r^2, where r is the radius.
- For the rectangle, use the formula: width * height.
- For the triangle, use the formula: 0.5 * base * height.
